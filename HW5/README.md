This example shows how to use PwmOut to modulate LED blinking.
link the certain pin and GND pin to the LED, and it will start blinking

**Note**: Set the PWM pin and cycle time. Then set the duty cycle using either a relative time period with the `write()` function or an absolute time period using the `pulsewidth()` function.
